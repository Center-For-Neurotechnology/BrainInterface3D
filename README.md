BrainInterface3D

BrainInterface3D is a modular pipeline incorporating multiple imaging modalites, 3D modelling, and making use of 3Dslicer to integrate MRI, fMRI, CT, 3D electrode models, vasculature, and any relevant and useful information to be used in planning electrode placement such as for brain computer interfaces. The steps involve multiple software packages (listed below), most of which are open-source.
